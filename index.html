          <h3>Guitar</h3>
          <p class="skill-description">
            I am an avid guitar player and have been playing the guitar since I
            was 9 years old. It offers me an avenue in which I can truly be
            expressive. I play the guitar for my local church :)

          <h3>Programming</h3>
          <p class="skill-description even-text">
            I was introduced to coding in my first semester University with the
            C/C++ languages, and then further in my Object-Oriented Programming
            course. I then went on to deepen my knowledge in C++ with
            TheCherno's C++ online courses, and then ran Harvard's Computer
            Science CS50x course in which I further familiarized myself with
            Python, SQL(Sqlite3), the Flask Framework, and Jinja templating, and
            have been working on completing projects since.

          <h3>PCB, Circuit Design, and Embedded Systems</h3>
          <p class="skill-description">
            Over the course of my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, I
            was introduced to and well trained in the designing of Printed
            Circuit Boards. My training was intensive, involving everything from
            the simulation of circuits on software such as TINA-TI, to the
            physical simulation of circuits using breadboards and finally the
            modelling of circuit boards on software like EAGLE. I also undertook
            an Rmbedded Systems Engineer position at the Faculty of Physics at 
            the University of Debrecen during which I was required to program a 
            microcontroller (ESP32) using Embedded C (and some libraries) to 
            interface with certain sensors to form a sensing system. I networked
            the system to stream its data to a cloud platform to allow for 
            real-time remote sensing.

          <h3>Teaching</h3>
          <p class="skill-description even-text">
            I currently teach English online, and have been doing so for the
            past 3 years. I initially took it up for financial reasons, but I
            quickly realised that I learn just as much from my students as they
            do from me. This helped me discover my passion for gathering
            knowledge, and this job has resulted in me developing people skills,
            the ability to present information in a clear and concise manner
            that has translated well into the rest of my group work, and a lot
            of miscallaneous knowledge. I would do well at Trivia ;)

         <h3>PLC</h3>
         <p class="skill-description">
            During my specialisation in Automation in my final year of my Electrical
            Engineering BSc. I was introduced to the Programmable Logic Controllers
            and their uses in Automation, as well as their functioning, programming,
            and the designing of systems they are used in. My training in them
            was in depth, involving their different circuits, power ratings,
            module types, programming (usually in C/C++ but sometimes in higher
            level languages) and network systems and standards.
